Hephaestus is brought to you by the same people that modified archiso for use as Archlemur.
It is the ISO builder for Pantheon Linux.  Currently Hephaestus is usable as is, but will
be undergoing a full re-write so as to scale better with the needs of Pantheon Linux.  

Our goal is to take the small collection of scripts that Hephaestus is based on and turn
them into a user-friendly (layman user-friendly) application suite that can be adapated
to the needs of anyone wanting to take a base Arch Linux install image and modify it 
for their purposes.
